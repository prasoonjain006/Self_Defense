## Problem Statement :--
The dangers of cyber-crime have been there for many years, but the increase in the
percentage of the population connected to the Internet and the time spent online,
combined with the sense of confinement and the anxiety and fear generated from the
lockdown, have provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to take advantage of
the situation and make more money or create disruption Attack.
- Which group of people are susceptible to these types of cyber attacks ?
- Propose a solution to help this group against cyber attacks.
## Idea :-
Why are cyber frauds increasing day by day ? The main cause is **unawareness** of
people. Following an SMS to get prize money, someone pretending to be a bank
employee, giving out a job in return for a huge sum of money , these types of attacks
make up most of the cyber frauds in India. Below is the statement of a senior police
officer on increasing cases of cyber frauds. We can find similar statements after
almost every cyber attack.
> The only way to avoid such fraud among the people is awareness.
>
> They should not reveal their bank details to anyone because no banks asked any account holder details
on the phone.

### Increasing Cyber frauds:
This news article shows there is an urgent need to limit
these cyber frauds, and making people aware is the only way out.
## Proposed Solution :--
1. **Susceptible group of people :** As we know anybody can be the victim of
cyber-attack, but uneducated people, people who have limited access to the
internet, people who can easily be manipulated , older people are easy targets
of cyber-criminals.
2. **Whatâ€™s the root cause :** Though there are various types of people who are
susceptible to cyber attacks, but we can group all of them under one class i.e
**unawareness**. And this root cause of lack of awareness is the base of our
Proposed solution.
3. **Key Points of our Solution :**
    - **Create awareness :-** among people about what are the different ways
    they can be attacked. All the most common methods such as phishing ,
    social engineering , scam by sending sms, fraud by pretending to be
    members of a famous organization.
    - **Connect Cyber Expert :-** we will ask cyber experts to join us on the
    volunteer basis. They can help common people on general topics, and
    post anything new about cyber security.
    - **Steps:-** Most of the people do not even know what to do if they are victim
    of cyber fraud , so we have included all the steps people must take if they
    are attacked by cyber criminals, so that the chances of recovery
    becomes high.
